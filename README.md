tvProgram
=========

Whenever I sit down in front of my TV and want to watch something, there
comes a dilema: "What's playing now? On which channel is my favorite
station?". 

This may seem strange but despite having quite modern TV set I just
don't own any set-top-box, that would allow me to press a button and see
those things. Since I'm nowwhere near of buying that kind of hardware
and am just using what my cable provider gives at its lowest prices, I'm
stuck.

That's why I've written this small Android app. It lists programs based
on a predefined list of channels. Info on what's playing at the moment
is being fetched from http://www.teleman.pl/program-tv?stations=all


How does this look?
